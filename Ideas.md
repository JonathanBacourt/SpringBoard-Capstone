Idea 1:  #preferred project
    Have an application that takes an IP address and shows the location using ip info API from: https://rapidapi.com/neutrinoapi/api/IP%20Info
    then using that data shows the crime rate for that area using https://rapidapi.com/andruxnet/api/world-cities
    - Takes ip address from user as input
    - Uses IP to query world-cities api to find crime rate
    - Will allow user to compare their cities crime rate with the ip addresses city

Idea 2: 
    Have a application that takes letters and shows all the possible words that it can form using: https://www.wordsapi.com/
    - take the letters from user as input
    - send the possible words as output
    - next to possible words will give the definition of the words

Idea 3:
    scrambled word Game that uses word api to generate a word that the user has to guess from a clue. Each new word will be one letter longer than the last
    until the dictionary runs out: https://www.wordsapi.com/
    - give user one try before moving on
    - will increment the size of the word
    - points will be calculated by size of word added to score
